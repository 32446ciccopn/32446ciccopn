			<img src="./harman.png" width="250" class="img-esq" alt="Harman Smith">
		</header>
		The commander of the killer7.
		An elderly old man in a wheelchair who spends most of his time in a comatose state getting abused by his maid,
		Samantha.
		When he's awake though, he wields a high-velocity sniper rifle and plays a mean game of chess.
		In gameplay, he has the highest stamina of all the Smiths, but he is only usable in particular scenes.

		</header>
		The second-in-command.
		The only member of the killer7 who directly reports to Harman.
		A suave, detached man whose job as a "cleaner" leaves him without remorse for the dead.
		He can resurrect any of the Smiths who are killed in action by venturing out into the field and collecting their
		head.
		He uses a silenced pistol, but isn't very effective in combat.
		He wields the Vision Ring, which allows him (and the others) to see the Heaven Smiles, as well as a large
		suitcase.

		</header>

		wasn't enthusiastic about fighting the Heaven Smiles.
		He wields a powerful revolver which can unleash a massive blast of energy called the Collateral Shot.
		The only member of the team besides Harman and Garcian to have his past explored in detail.
		He later revives his ultimate weapon: the Demon Gun.

		</header>
		The only girl.
		A sarcastic yet downtrodden woman with a permanent bloodstain on her dress and no shoes, giving her the nickname
		"Barefoot".
		She can slit her wrists and use the ensuing Rain of Blood to destroy hidden barriers, as well as absorb other
		blood into herself.
		Her pistol has a very handy scope.
		Notably, when written in Japanese, her name uses kanji instead of katakana (yes, even the Smith).
